## Install
```sh
go get github.com/dstgo/steamapi@latest
```

## Supported Interface

Since the host is `partner.steam-api.com`, the interface needs the publisher key to call, and the publisher key must be 100$ to register, so we have no way to get its specific response, so the interface The unified return type is `map[string]any`

## Example

**GetServerInfo** interface has no apikey required, but you should pass a key still.In this case, 
you can pass a `steamapi.NopKey` to New func which just a meaningless string.

```go
// initialize client with NopKey
client, err := steamapi.New(steamapi.NopKey)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
// call the webapiutil interface
info, err := client.ISteamWebAPIUtil().GetServerInfo()
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
fmt.Printf("%+v", info)
```
output
```
{ ServerTime: 1693832041 ServerTimeString: Mon Sep  4 05:54:01 2023 }
```



**GetSupportedAPIList** interface needs to pass your own apikey

```go

// pass your own key
client, err := steamapi.New(key)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
list, err := client.ISteamWebAPIUtil().GetSupportedAPIList()
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
fmt.Printf("%+v", list)
```
output
```
{ApiList:{Interfaces:[{Name:IClientStats_1046930 Methods:[{Name:ReportEvent Version:1 HttpMethod:POST Parameters:[]}]} {Name:ICSGOPlayers_730...
...
...
...
```
